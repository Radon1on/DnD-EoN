full body portrait of a rugged anthropomorphic wolf (werewolf), medium build, clad in crude fur pelts and leather straps, holding a tall, primitive spear with a stone tip. He is standing in a snow-covered taiga forest at twilight, with dense, dark pines and faint aurora borealis in the sky. The style is a grim, rough illustration, hand-drawn with ink and charcoal, featuring heavy cross-hatching, textured paper, visible sketch lines, and splatters. Moody and dark atmosphere, desolate tundra, calm gloom, cinematic lighting, deep shadows, limited palette of dark blues, greys, and earthy tones. Masterpiece, high detail, raw artistic expression.
